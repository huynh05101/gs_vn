The fundamental purpose of a marketing plan is to improve the success of your business or organization. If done well, a marketing plan can provide insight into your business, define your objectives and strategy, and help ensure that youâ€™re providing effective services or products to your customers.

What your marketing plan looks like will depend on the size and type of your business, but even small businesses can benefit from careful planning.

A typical marketing plan outline will include an executive summary or overview of the plan, a description of your target customers and their needs, clearly defined marketing objectives, your marketing strategy - including product, price, distribution and promotion, an action plan, and budget projections. Your marketing plan may also include a SWOT analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses within your business as well as external opportunities and threats. Including a method of evaluation in your plan will help you monitor its success and get a clear picture of your return on investment.

No matter what elements you include in your plan, using a template can save time, provide organization, and enhance communication within your marketing team or between departments.

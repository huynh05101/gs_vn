_Agile frameworks like Scrum, Lean or Kanban are widely used across many industries. Each has its own focus, features, process, benefits and drawbacks. Here's how to decide which framework work best for your next project._

Agile is an increasingly popular methodology choice for project management. It was initially developed for projects that require significant flexibility and speed, breaking down delivery cycles into short, iterative bursts, known as “sprints.”

As a project management methodology, agile is highly interactive, allowing for rapid adjustments throughout a project. It also offers repeatable processes, reduces risk, allows for immediate feedback, provides fast turnaround and reduces complexity.

Now let's take a closer look at three popular agile frameworks and how they compare to make it easier to choose which to use for your next project.

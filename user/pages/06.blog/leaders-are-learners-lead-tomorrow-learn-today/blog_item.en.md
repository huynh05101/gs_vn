Leadership develops daily not in a day. Benjamin Disraeli asserted, " The secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his time when it comes." The secret of true leadership lies in your daily agenda. Leadership doesn't just happen in someone's life some day, because leadership is a process. What you do every day determines your level of leadership. To become an excellent leader you need to work every day. No one become a good leader unless he canges something he does daily. Leadership is a process.


* There is old saying that champions don't become champions in the ring - they are merely recognised there. If you want to see where someone develops into champion, look at his daily routine. Former heavyweight champ Jeo Fraizer stated,  "You can map out a fight plan or life plan. But when the action starts, you are down to your reflexes. That 's where your road work shows. If you cheated on that in the dark of the morning, you are getting found out now under the bright lights." Boxing is a good analogy for leadership development because it is all about daily preparation. Even a person with natural talent has to prepare and train to become successfull.

* Theodore Roosevelt uses boxing as analogy in his famous qoute;

* It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually  in the arena; where is face marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.


British historian Hugh Brogan described Theodore Roosevelt as, "the ablest man to sit in the White House since Lincoln; the most vigorous since Jackson; the most bookish since John Quincy Adams."

## NOTHING HAPPENS OVERNIGHT BUT A DAILY PROCESS:

* Roosevelt didn't become a great leader overnight, either. His road to Presidency was one of slow, continual growth. As he served in various positions, ranging from New York City Police Commissioner to President of the United States, he kept learning and growing. He improved himself, and in the time he became strong leader, that is further evidence that he lived by the Law of Process.


* Roosevelt's list of accomplishment is remarkable. On January6, 1919, at his home in New York, Theodro Roosevelt died in his sleep. Then Vice President Marshal said, " Death had to take him sleeping, for if Roosevelt had been awake, there would have been fight." When they removed him they found book under his pillow. Up to the very last, TR was still striving to learn and improve himself. He was still practicing Law of Process.


* If you want to be a leader, the good news is that you can do it. Everyone has the potential, but is not accomplished overnight. It requires perseverance. Absolutely no, you can't ignore the Law of Process. Leadership doesn't develop in a day. It takes LIFE TIME.( Abstract from the 21 irrefutable Laws of Leadership authored by Dr. John C. Maxwell)  


* Leaning in to unlearn,learn,relearn is a continous process in leadership journey!

### ## Why PMI certifications matter

On December 14, 2016, US President Barack Obama signed into law S.1550, the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act of 2015 (PMIAA) to enhance accountability and best practices in project and program management throughout the federal government. This move signifies the importance of project professionals at all levels and the ongoing need for standardization, accountability, and ethics in the PM field.

Further, the project management profession is anticipated to grow by US$6.61 trillion by 2020, adding 15.7 million new PM roles, and PM certifications can provide professionals with the necessary skills to meet the growing demand.
